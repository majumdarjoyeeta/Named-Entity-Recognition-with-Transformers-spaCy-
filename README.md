Identify 👤 People, 🏙️ Locations, 🏢 Organizations & More using AI & NLP!

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** — a powerful task in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** that extracts meaningful data like names, places, organizations, dates, and more from raw, unstructured text.

We use a **Transformer-based NER model** (`dslim/bert-base-NER`) from **Hugging Face's** 🤗 `transformers` along with **spaCy** for beautiful visualizations.

NER is widely used in real-world applications:

- 🔍 **Search engines**
- 📰 **News summarization**
- 💬 **Customer service automation**
- 📊 **Business intelligence**

## ⚙️ Installation
Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install transformers spacy gradio
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
📖 Example Sentences
These are used to test and visualize entity recognition:

python
Copy
Edit
examples = [
    "Apple Inc. plans to invest in Bangalore, India by 2026. Tim Cook met PM Modi in New Delhi.",
    "Barack Obama was born in Hawaii and served as the 44th President of the United States.",
    "Elon Musk is the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, and he visited Berlin last week.",
    "The FIFA World Cup 2022 was held in Qatar and won by Argentina.",
    "Amazon Web Services opened a new region in Hyderabad, India."
]
🔍 How It Works
1. Load Transformer NER Model
python
Copy
Edit
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForTokenClassification, pipeline

def load_ner_model(model_name="dslim/bert-base-NER"):
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
    model = AutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)
    return pipeline("ner", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)

ner_pipe = load_ner_model()
2. Visualize Entities & Syntax with spaCy
python
Copy
Edit
import spacy
spacy_nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

def convert_to_displacy_format(text, ner_results):
    d_result = { "text": text, "title": None }
    ents = []
    current_entity = None
    for ent in ner_results:
        if "B-" in ent["entity"]:
            if current_entity:
                ents.append(current_entity)
            current_entity = {
                "label": ent["entity"][2:],
                "start": ent["start"],
                "end": ent["end"]
            }
        elif "I-" in ent["entity"] and current_entity:
            current_entity["end"] = ent["end"]
    if current_entity:
        ents.append(current_entity)
    d_result["ents"] = ents
    return d_result
🖼️ Visualization
For every input text:

📌 Highlighted Named Entities using displacy

🌳 Display Dependency Trees for syntactic structure

for text in examples:
    ner_results = ner_pipe(text)
    displacy_format = convert_to_displacy_format(text, ner_results)

    # Named Entity Visualization
    spacy.displacy.render(displacy_format, style="ent", manual=True, jupyter=True)

    # Dependency Tree
    doc = spacy_nlp(text)
    spacy.displacy.render(doc, style="dep", jupyter=True)
🔮 What's Next?
✅ Add a Gradio UI for user input & live results

🌍 Fine-tune NER model on custom datasets

📦 Export recognized entities to CSV / JSON

🧠 Integrate into larger NLP pipelines

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** — a powerful task in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** that extracts meaningful data like **names**, **places**, **organizations**, **dates**, and more from raw, unstructured text 📝.

We leverage a **Transformer-based NER model** (`dslim/bert-base-NER`) from **Hugging Face's** 🤗 `transformers` library along with **spaCy** 🐍 for **beautiful visualizations** 🌟.

NER is widely used in **real-world applications** 🌍:

- 🔍 **Search Engines**  
- 📰 **News Summarization**  
- 💬 **Customer Service Automation**  
- 📊 **Business Intelligence**  
- 🎮 **Game Development**

## ⚙️ Installation
To get started, you'll need to install the required packages 🛠️:

```bash
pip install transformers spacy gradio
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
📖 Example Sentences
These example sentences help test and visualize the entity recognition 🌐:

python

examples = [
    "Apple Inc. plans to invest in Bangalore, India by 2026. Tim Cook met PM Modi in New Delhi.",
    "Barack Obama was born in Hawaii and served as the 44th President of the United States.",

🔍 How It Works
1. Load Transformer NER Model 🤖
First, we load the transformer-based NER model from Hugging Face’s 🤗 transformers library:

python
Copy
Edit
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForTokenClassification, pipeline

def load_ner_model(model_name="dslim/bert-base-NER"):
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
    model = AutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)
    return pipeline("ner", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)

ner_pipe = load_ner_model()
2. Visualize Entities & Syntax with spaCy 🔍
We use spaCy 🐍 for visualizing the recognized entities and the syntax of the input text. Here’s how:

python
Copy
Edit
import spacy
spacy_nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

def convert_to_displacy_format(text, ner_results):
    d_result = { "text": text, "title": None }
    ents = []
    current_entity = None
    for ent in ner_results:
        if "B-" in ent["entity"]:
            if current_entity:
                ents.append(current_entity)
            current_entity = {
                "label": ent["entity"][2:],
                "start": ent["start"],
                "end": ent["end"]
            }
        elif "I-" in ent["entity"] and current_entity:
            current_entity["end"] = ent["end"]
    if current_entity:
        ents.append(current_entity)
    d_result["ents"] = ents
    return d_result
🖼️ Visualization
For every input text 📄:

📌 Highlight Named Entities using displacy

for text in examples:
    ner_results = ner_pipe(text)
    displacy_format = convert_to_displacy_format(text, ner_results)
